Problem 1:
"A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of each node pointing simply to the next node in 
a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes"

Operations on a binary_tree
    1.Inserting an element into a tree
    2. Deleting an element from a tree
    3. Searching for an element
    4.Traversing the tree

    Classifying the Traversals
        - Preorder Traversals
            *each node is processed before processing the sub treee
        - Inorder Traversals
        - Postorder Traversals
